# Eat-Da-Burger!

## Customer Interface

This application allows users to create the name of new burgers. Burgers are then displayed as `Ready-to-eat Burgers`, along with a `Devour It!` button. Clicking that button moves the burger into another column, labeled `Devoured Burgers`.

Built with JavaScript and Handlebars, AJAX calls, data stored and accessed with mySQL in a homemade ORM, using Node, Express, and deployed on Heroku. Node and MySQL are used to query and route the data, and Handlebars generates the HTML.

## Getting Started
